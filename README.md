## Diet-Tracker-Project

## App Description and Purpose

This application is meant to help the user track their health on a general basis. The user must input correct values for all fields except for the hazardous materials section. These fields are automatically calculated based on average values.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

The user may pull or download the zip of this project. It will contain everything except for dependencies contained within node_modules. These files are too large to upload, so their names will be shown in the demo video. After the dependencies are installed, the user must open a terminal. They will run "npm start" and click the local host url, then open a new terminal. There, they will run "cd backend" to move to the backend. Finally, they will run "npm run dev" to run the backend.

## Future Development Roadmap

I plan to add an automatic feature which tracks your last week's information in real life.
I also need to spend more time fact checking threshold levels.
